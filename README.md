Solutions to TopCoder problems in C++, Haskell, and other languages.

All solutions have been tested for correctness with [gettc](https://github.com/seri/gettc), a tool to assist running your TopCoder solutions without the official online arena.

The problem statement for each solution can be found at [TopCoder Problem Archieve](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemArchive). 

These solutions are written in my own time (that means: not during contest) so I try to make them as clean as clear as possible.

- D1L1 = Division 1 - 250 points
- D1L2 = Division 1 - 500 points
- D1L3 = Division 1 - 1000 points
- D2L1 = Division 2 - 250 points
- D2L2 = Division 2 - 500 points
- D2L3 = Division 2 - 1000 points
