Solutions to TopCoder problems in C++, Haskell, and other languages.

All solutions have been tested for correctness with [gettc](https://github.com/seri/gettc), a tool to assist running your TopCoder solutions without the official online arena.

The problem statement for each solution can be found at [TopCoder Problem Archieve](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=ProblemArchive). You will need to log in. It would be convenient to include the problem statements somewhere but it's TopCoder's property so I can't do that.
